# Airplane Sorting Algorithms Lab ✈️ 

Welcome to the Airplane Sorting Algorithms Lab! This Java program demonstrates the implementation of selection sort and merge sort algorithms to sort an array of airplanes based on their duration and capacity.

## Introduction ✍️ 
This lab showcases the application of selection sort and merge sort algorithms to efficiently organize airplanes based on their duration and capacity. It includes a variety of runtime statistics to compare the performance of these sorting algorithms.

## How to Run 💻 
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AirplaneSortingAlgorithms`
3. Compile the Java program: `javac AirplaneSortingAlgorithms.java`
4. Run the program: `java AirplaneSortingAlgorithms`

Feel free to experiment with the code and explore the results!
