# Airplane Sorting Algorithms Lab 🛫

Welcome to the Airplane Sorting Algorithms Lab! This Java program showcases the implementation of selection sort and merge sort algorithms to efficiently organize airplanes based on their duration and capacity.

## 🌟 Introduction
This lab takes you through the application of selection sort and merge sort algorithms to effectively sort airplanes based on their duration and capacity. Dive into the details and explore the runtime statistics provided for a comprehensive analysis of sorting algorithm efficiency.

## 🚀 Sorting Algorithms
### Selection Sort
- **Duration**: Arranges airplanes in ascending order of duration.
- **Capacity**: Arranges airplanes in ascending order of capacity.

### Merge Sort
- **Duration**: Arranges airplanes in ascending order of duration.
- **Capacity**: Arranges airplanes in ascending order of capacity.
